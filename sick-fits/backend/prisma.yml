# You can deploy this file using 
#     prisma deploy
# Since we are using a non-default naming convention for our variables file we'll need to use
#     prisma deploy -e variables.env


# Once it is deployed, the "post-deploy" hook will run, and it will download 
# the schema to src/generated/prisma.graphql
# THIS IS THE MAGIC BEHIND GraphQL - It creates all the API queries and mutations for you.
